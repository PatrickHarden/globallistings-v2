## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>

# CMS Config

We have introduced new config values in v2, mostly to be able to modify url path. Currently the template for url structure is `/:usageType/:transactionType/:location/results'` check `src/constants/routePaths.ts` file in the repo for a most up to date version.

## Usage Type

Usage type (e.g. office, retails, other) allow to dynamically change the config without doing a full page refresh. To use this feature we need to setup a config options:

```json
{
  "currentConfig": "office", // name of the current config, this has to match the name defined in one of the filters.options
  "filters": [
    {
      "name": "usageType", // A part of the URL which will be changed, check url structure above for supported segments
      "type": "select", // Has to be `select`
      "modifier": "url", // Has to be `url`, supports `url` and `query`.
      "placement": "lm_primaryFilter", // Position of the filter
      "label": "Property Type", // A label which will be displayed in the UI as a header for the dropdown (can be anything)
      "options": [
        { "value": "office", "label": "Office", "default": false }, // None of the options ca be default
        { "value": "industrial", "label": "Industrial", "default": false }, // value has to correspond to the `otherConfigs.name`
        { "value": "retail", "label": "Retail", "default": false }
      ] // All options defined, must include the current config (`office`) in the list as well
    }
  ],
  "otherConfigs": [
    {
      "endpoint": "https://uat.immobiliare.cbre.it/it-IT/api/spaconfig/145",
      "name": "retail" // Name must correspond to the name defined in the config 145 under property `currentConfig`
    },
    {
      "endpoint": "https://uat.immobiliare.cbre.it/it-IT/api/spaconfig/142",
      "name": "other" // Name also has to correspond to the `filters.options`
    }
  ]
}
```

## Transaction Type

Transaction type defines if the property is for sale to let.

```json
{
  "filters": [
    {
      "name": "transactionType", // Part of the url it will modify
      "type": "select", // Has to be select
      "modifier": "url", // Has to be url
      "label": "TransType", // Can be anything defines what label is shown in the UI
      "placement": "lm_primaryFilter", // Filter placement
      "options": [
        { "value": "letting", "label": "To Let", "default": true }, // A default one has to be specified
        { "value": "sale", "label": "To Buy", "default": false } // only letting and sale is allowed
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

If want to support more types we will have to modify SPA to add additional mappings
